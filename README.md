Perspectives
============

A game made during the Ludum Dare #23. I fixed a few bugs afterwards but this is mostly what I had done during the competion.

It's a game about the different perspectives that one can have about a certain place.
The player is led to discover the world thanks to friendly NPCs and the higher she gets the greater she can see the world as it is.
