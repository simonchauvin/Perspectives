Hi, I'm Simon.

I actually wanted to let you know that Perspectives is the game made during the 23th Ludum Dare. The theme was "Tiny World".
I decided to try and make a game about the different perspectives that one can have about a certain place.
The player is led to discover the world further thanks to friendly NPCs and the higher she gets the greater she can see the world as it is.
In spite of the bugs and lack of time to finish the game I hope that you will enjoy it !
